  "Description": "Giulio's Quirk, Neutralization, allows him to temporarily nullify someone's Quirk Factor whenever he touches them with his right arm, effectively making them Quirkless for a short period of time. Due to losing his right arm, which stored his own Quirk Factor, he became unable to activate Neutralization.",
