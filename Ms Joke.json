  "Description": "Ms Joke's Quirk Outburst has never been seen being used in action, but its functions have been described by Izuku Midoriya. According to him, this Quirk allows the user to force others around them to burst into laughter so intense that it dulls their motor skills and cognitive abilities. It is useful for incapacitating villains. The full extent of this Quirk's power, as well as its limitations, are currently unknown",
