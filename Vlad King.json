  "Description": "Sekijiro Kan's Quirk, Blood Control, allows him to freely manipulate his own blood after it has left his body. He can also solidify the ejected blood, allowing him to trap his opponent. It appears that Vlad's Quirk allows him to go unaffected by levels of blood loss that would normally be fatal to the average human.",
