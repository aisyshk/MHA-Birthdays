  "Character": "Eijiro Kirishima",
  "Description": "Eijiro's Quirk, Hardening, gives him the power to harden and sharpen any or all parts of his body, causing his flesh to become jagged and rock-like. There is a limit to how much damage his hardened body can withstand, which causes the Hardening itself to slowly dissipate, and Eijiro to lose stamina from struggling to keep his Quirk active.",
