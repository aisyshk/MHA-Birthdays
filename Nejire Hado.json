  "Character": "Nejire Hado",
  "Description": "Nejire's Quirk, Wave Motion, grants her the ability to convert her own vitality into energy and release it in the form of exceptionally powerful spiral shockwaves. Since the energy travels in a spiral, it's not very fast. Overusing this Quirk will cause Nejire to suffer from great exhaustion, due to it using her own stamina as a power source.",
