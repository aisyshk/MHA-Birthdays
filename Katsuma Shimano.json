  "Description": "Katsuma's Quirk, Cell Activation, allows him to stimulate and speed up the activity of cells in the body of anyone he touches. This allows him to heal a person's wounds, as well as improve their physical performance. Using his Quirk drains his stamina and he will become very exhausted if he uses it for too long. It is implied he can use his Quirk on himself as well.",
