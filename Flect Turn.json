  "Description": "Flect Turn's Quirk, Reflect, allows him to reflect any attack and its effect back at it's user. He can also store the attack to use later, rather than just reflecting it immediately. This Quirk isn't well suited for enduring several powerful attacks and will wear out in prolonged battles. A more powerful attack cannot be reflected by the Quirk.",
