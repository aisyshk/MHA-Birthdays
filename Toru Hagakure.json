  "Description": "Toru's Quirk, Invisibility, is that her body is completely invisible. In addition to the stealth capabilities granted to her by her invisible body, Toru can refract light that passes through her, allowing her to intensify the light into a blinding flash. Toru has further refined this application of her Quirk, achieving the ability to manipulate and redirect light-based attacks.",
