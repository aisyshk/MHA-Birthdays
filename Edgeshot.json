  "Description": "Edgeshot's Quirk, Foldabody, allows him to make his body and limbs extremely thin and long, effectively allowing him to transform himself into a razor-sharp string. He is able to transform faster than the speed of sound. Edgeshot can use his Quirk to move around quickly, slip through tight spaces, and pierce targets by folding himself into sharp shapes.",
