  "Description": "Mirio's Quirk, Permeation, allows him to become intangible, letting him pass through any tangible matter; he can phase through walls and/or the ground, as well as let enemy attacks pass through him harmlessly. If he returns to his solid state while phasing through something, his body will be repelled outward.",
