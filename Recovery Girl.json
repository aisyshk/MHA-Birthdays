  "Description": "Recovery Girl's Quirk, Heal, allows her to amplify and speed up the human body's natural healing process by planting a kiss on the injured person. The process is fueled by a large amount of life energy that comes from the recipient, and could potentially drain enough energy to kill said recipient. She also seems to be able to stretch her lips to an abnormal length.",
