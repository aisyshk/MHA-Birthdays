  "Description": "Tamakiâ€™s Quirk, Manifest, grants him the ability to manifest the physical characteristics of anything he's eaten and is significantly stronger than normal. The more of a substance Tamaki eats, the stronger his manifestation will be. He can only manifest the traits of substances that are still in his system and loses access to those traits once the substance is fully digested.",
