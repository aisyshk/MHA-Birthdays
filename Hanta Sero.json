  "Description": "Hanta's Quirk, Tape, is one that gives him tape dispenser-like organs in his elbows, from which he can shoot and retract long, sturdy cellophane tape-like strips. Overuse of his Quirk will cause his skin to dry out. He can use his tape to wrap people, swing long distances, and create traps, among other applications.",
