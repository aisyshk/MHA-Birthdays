  "Character": "Bruno Gollini",
  "Description": " Bruno's Quirk, ||Delay Spot, grants him the ability to create a semi-sphere-like bubble over an area, causing everything in the bubble to be stuck in slow motion, enough to slow down bullets to a mere crawl. The disadvantage doesn't affect Bruno though, as he remains to use his normal speed even when seen within the bubble.||",
