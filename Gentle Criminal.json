  "Description": "Danjuro Tobita's Quirk, Elasticity, allows him to bestow the property of elasticity to anything he touches, making it stretchable, bendable, and bouncy. This Quirk can affect anything, from the ground to the air itself. Gentle cannot cancel the effects himself, instead, the effect wears off on its own after time has passed.",
