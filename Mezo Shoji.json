  "Character": "Mezo Shoji",
  "Description": "Mezo's Quirk, Dupli-Arms, grants him a set of tentacles alongside his arms. He can transform the tips of these tentacles to replicate other parts of his body (ex: mouth, ears, eyes). The duplicated body parts are more efficient than the originals; as a result, Mezo is able to hear better, see-through more angles at a time, and they grant him much higher degrees of strength.",
