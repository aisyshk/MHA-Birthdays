  "Description": "Enji Todoroki's Quirk, Hellflame, allows him to produce and manipulate large amounts of extremely intense fire at will. He appears to be immune to other flames, and can easily control the shape and temperature of the blaze as well. Using too much of his power will overheat Endeavor's body, causing a depletion of stamina, and an impairment of his physical functions.",
