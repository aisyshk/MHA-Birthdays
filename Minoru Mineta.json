  "Description": "Minoru's Quirk, Pop Off, allows him to produce and pluck ball-shaped objects from his head; the balls grow back just as fast as they're plucked. The balls are incredibly sticky and will stick to any surface; the sole exception being Minoru himself. The duration of their adhesive quality is determined by his overall health. If he plucks too many, it will cause him to start bleeding from his scalp.",
