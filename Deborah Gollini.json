  "Description": "Deborah's Quirk, ||Day Dream, allows her to make any person she looks at fall unconscious, or to be put in a controllable, hypnotic state for a short period of time. Once she has locked onto a target just by sight alone, the victim's mind will be stuck in a dream-like world where they live out their deepest dreams and desires, rendering them nearly comatose.||",
