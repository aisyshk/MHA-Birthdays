  "Description": "Manga's Quirk, Comic, allows him to materialize words in midair by speaking them. These words are onomatopoeia (words that describe sounds) which can manifest the effects of the phenomenon that the sound suggests. The only drawback is that the overuse of his Quirk can cause him to get an incredibly sore throat.",
