  "Description": "Beros' Quirk, Longbow, allows her to transform her left thumb and pinky finger into the two ends of an archery bow, which lets her shoot projectiles with enough power to penetrate a car. She's also able to control the path of the objects she fires, allowing her to home in on her targets. However, she cannot create her own ammunition.",
