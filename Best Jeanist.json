  "Description": "Tsunagu Hakamada's Quirk, Fiber Master, allows him to freely manipulate the threads in any nearby piece of fabric. His Quirk works best with denim, and is least effective on sweats. He can unravel a part of his own clothing into strings and use them to restrain his targets, as well as use the target's own clothing against them.",
