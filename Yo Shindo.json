  "Description": "Yo's Quirk, Vibrate, gives him the ability to vibrate anything that he touches. His Quirk is strong enough that he can even create fierce tremors by using his power on the ground, but the aftershocks of his attacks can render him immobile. This power has allowed Yo to develop a natural resistance against vibrations.",
