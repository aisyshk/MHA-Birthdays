  "Description": "Tenya's Quirk, Engine, gives him car-like engines in each of his calves, giving him incredible running speed and extreme kicking power. Tenya needs to fuel his engines by drinking orange juice. Tenya's engines have multiple gears; it is currently unknown how many. His Quirk requires that the exhaust pipes on the backs of his legs remain clear of obstructions in order to function properly.",
