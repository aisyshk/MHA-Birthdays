  "Description": "Denki's Quirk, Electrification, allows him to generate electricity and cover his body in it. While he can also emit this energy over a distance, Denki has little to no control over it, meaning it will go everywhere indiscriminately. Exceeding his wattage limit causes his brain to short-circuit, leaving him in a vulnerable state for 1 hour. Denki is also able to absorb and neutralize electricity and other lightning-based Quirks.",
