  "Description": "Kyoka's Quirk, Earphone Jack, is that she has a pair of headphone jacks hanging from her earlobes, which can stretch several meters. When the jacks are plugged into something, Kyoka can channel the sound of her heartbeat through them in the form of a violent vibration attack. This Quirk also allows her to hear minuscule sounds and vibrations from her surroundings.",
